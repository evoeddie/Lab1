# Lab1: Push Something AroundControlling a Physical Thing        In Led.py we made an LED's brightness increase from 0 to maximum     over 5 seconds, then go back to 0 and repeat the process indefinitely.     Until Ctrl+C or Nucleo power is cut off.     Motor Control        We made a motor driver class called MotorDriver in a file motor_driver.py        We wrote test code in motor_driver.py which exercises our motor driver.     Testing        We tested our motor driver class by sending it a range of duty cycles,     both positive and negative, and checking that the motor moves both ways.        We also checked edge cases such as the max and min possilbe duty cucles for    proper operation.
